# Deployment

These sections will discuss options for a production deployment of the OCS applications, as well as information on intial setup for the main OCS applications. To begin, go to [Local Deployment]({% link deployment/local_deployment.md %}) for instructions on how to run the OCS applications on a single machine or network of machines, or go to [Kubernetes Deployment]({% link deployment/k8s_deployment.md %}) for information on deploying the OCS applications using helm charts and kubernetes, which can be done on a cloud service provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Once you have the applications deployed, check out the [ConfigDB Setup]({% link deployment/configdb_setup.md %}) and [Observation Portal Setup]({% link deployment/obs_portal_setup.md %}) sections for information on how to initialize the databases of those applications.
